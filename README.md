# node.js blob service gateway.

Copyright (c) 2011-2012 VMware, Inc.

The blob service provides an S3-compatible HTTP endpoint to an underlying 
storage provider. A driver model is used for different providers. Currently 
the available drivers include S3 (Amazon web services) or a local file system 
(FS) driver.

## Authors
- Sonic Wang (wangs@vmware.com)

## Features
- RESTful web service
- S3 compatibility
- plugin model (currently support local fs, s3)
- streaming in/out blobs
- basic blob operations: create/delete/get/copy
- create/list/delete buckets
- enumerate objects with prefix/delimiter/marker/max-keys
- user defined meta data

## FS driver

For scalability, the file system driver supports multiple instances of the 
gateway operating on the same files. Metadata and blobs live in separate 
physical files in different directories. New files do not replace existing 
files until they have been fully uploaded and persisted. Old files are cleaned 
up using garbage collection processes which run in the background.

The file system driver was designed to provide consistency without the use of 
any database. It depends on the file system for reference-counting hard links 
and atomic 'mv' operations.

## API Documentation
- For details of supported API features see the [doc](doc) directory

## Dependencies

The following 3rd party npm modules have been included in the node_modules 
subdirectory

- express: web framework 
- winston: logging module
- sax: xml parser
- vows: test framework

## Installing node.js

The blob service depends on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). We are working with 
the v0.6 branch and v0.6.10 tag.

To match the same branch and tag from github:

    $> git clone -b v0.6 https://github.com/joyent/node.git <target-directory>
    $> cd <target-directory>
    $> git checkout v0.6.10

To build node.js

    ./configure
    make
    make install

## Installing npm

Most node.js applications require modules distributed via npm. Instructions 
for installing npm can be found at [npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org/).

## Deploying the blob service from source

    $> git clone <project-url> <target-directory>
    $> cd <target-directory>
    $> cp config.json.default config.json
    
now edit `config.json`

## Configuration via config.json

The gateway and its drivers can be configured via config.json which is read at 
startup. This file is structured as an array of drivers each with a name, 
type, and options, followed by some global options which include the name of 
the current driver. It is possible to configure multiple drivers of the same 
same type in the same file, but only one of these will be activated on 
startup.

Drivers are assumed to live under `./drivers/<type>` -- currently only `fs` 
and `s3` driver types are included.

The FS driver stores all blobs in directories and files under a "root" 
location in the local file system. The default location if this value is 
unspecified is `./fs_root`

The S3 driver requires a valid key and secret from your Amazon S3 storage 
account. All operations are simply passed through the gateway and handled by 
S3.

NOTE: if no config.json file is found, the gateway will use the settings from 
`config.json.default`. The following listing shows all currently available 
config.json options for the FS and S3 drivers.

    {
        "drivers": [
        {
            "<fs-driver-name>": {
                "type": "fs",
                "option": {
                    "root": "<pathname for storing blobs - default is `./fs_root` >",
                    "node_exepath": "<path to node executable - default is `node` >",
                    "collector" : <enable gc and enumeration - default is `true`, NOTE: must be limited to one instance >,
                    "tmp_path" : "<path to a global tmp folder for storing runtime temp files, default is `/tmp` >",
                    "gc_exepath": "<path to gc js file, default is `drivers/fs/fs_gc.js` >",
                    "gc_interval": <ms per gc execution, default is `600,000` (10 min) >,
                    "gcfc_exepath": "<path to lightweight gc js file, default is `drivers/fs/fs_gcfc.js` >",
                    "gcfc_interval": <ms per lightweiht gc execution, default is `1,500` (1.5 sec) >,
                    "gctmp_exepath": "<path to tmp folder gc js file, default is `drivers/fs/fs_gctmp.js` >",
                    "gctmp_interval": <ms per tmp folder gc execution, default is 3,600,000 (1 hr) >,
                    "ec_exepath": "<path to ec js file, default is `drivers/fs/fs_ec.js` >",
                    "ec_interval": <ms per ec execution, default is `1,500` (1.5 sec) >,

                    "obj_limit" : <maximum number of blobs allowed to store, default is 10,000 >
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "<s3-driver-name>": {
                "type": "s3",
                "option": {
                    "key": "<s3 key>",
                    "secret": "<s3 secret>"
                }
            }
        }
        ],
        "port": "<port>",
        "current_driver": "<driver-name>",
        "logtype": "winston",
        "logfile": "<pathname for the log>",
        "keyID": "<id for front-end authentication>",
        "secretID": "<secret for front-end authentication>",
        "auth": "<`basic`, `digest` or `s3`; other values mean disabled>",
        "debug": <set to true to enable verbose output of all requests in the console>,
        "account_file" : <pathname for the cloudfoundry binding file, default is "./account.json">,
        "account_api" : <set to true to enable cloudfoundry service apis, default is true>
    }

`current driver` is used to specify the driver to be used by the service at 
startup. Only 1 driver can be in use at any time. If no default is specified 
the first driver will be used.

`logfile` specifies the path to the log file. The `logtype` has to be 
[winston](https://github.com/indexzero/winston).

`keyID` and `secretID` and `auth` are used to control front-end 
authentication. If either the key or id is not present or if auth is not set 
to a proper auth type then authentication is disabled. Currently the following 
types are supported: "basic", "digest", and "s3". "basic" and "digest" 
implementation follows rfc2617.

`debug` is used to log request and response headers to the console for 
debugging purposes. Its value is treated as boolean.

`account_file` is the place where vblob instance stores the CloudFoundry 
service binding credentials. After a vblob service instance is provisioned in 
CloundFoundry, user can binding multiple CF apps to the instance. This file 
indicates vblob where to load and update the binding crendentials so that the 
apps can properly authenticate with the vblob instance. `account_api` controls 
whether the CF bind/unbind API is on/off in the instance. For a single node 
deployment, this is always set to true. For a multi-node deployment, only one 
node should turn on this switch.

## Usage

    node server.js [-f path_to_config_file]
    
Note that `-f config-path` is optional. The gateway will look for `./config.json` or `./config.json.default`

## Testing

To run the common (non-driver-specific) unit tests, first make sure server.js 
is configured and running with one of the drivers, then

    cd test
    ../node_modules/vows/bin/vows common_test/test*.js --spec

To run the fs-driver tests from the same test folder do:

    ../node_modules/vows/bin/vows fs_test/test*.js --spec

NOTE: To avoid invoking vows via ../node_modules, install vows globally using 
`npm install -g vows`
        
## Manual usage with curl

The following curl commands assume:

- authentication is NOT enabled. 
- the node.js process is running on localhost and listening on port 9981.

### Listing all buckets

    curl http://localhost:9981 -v

### Listing objects in a bucket
  
    curl http://localhost:9981/container1 -v

Four parameters are supported: prefix; delimiter; marker; max-keys. E.g.:

    curl "http://localhost:9981/container1/?prefix=A/&delimiter=/" -v

The above query will list virtual folders in 'container1' starting with 'A/' 
and using delimiter '/'.

### Create a bucket

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1 -X PUT -v

### Delete a bucket

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1 -X DELETE -v

### Uploading a file

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -X PUT -T file1.txt -v

User-defined metadata is supported. All user meta keys start with prefix 
`x-amz-meta-`. E.g.

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -X PUT -T file1.txt -H "x-amz-meta-comment:hello_world"

### Copying a file

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -X PUT -H "x-amz-copy-source:/container2/file2.txt"

The above request copy file2.txt in container2 to file1.txt in container1. 
This operation will copy meta data as well.

### Deleting a file

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -X DELETE -v

### Reading a file

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -v

Standard `range` headers are supported for single range reads. E.g.

    curl http://localhost:9981/container1/file1.txt -H "range:bytes=123-892" -v

## Using s3-curl with gateway authentication

Instead of using curl with authentication disabled, the gateway can also be 
accessed in an authenticated fashion via s3-curl.pl which is a utility for 
making signed requests to s3 available on 
[aws](http://aws.amazon.com/code/128).

Credentials for authentication via s3-curl are stored in `.s3curl` as follows

    %awsSecretAccessKeys = (

        # real s3 account
        s3 => {
            id => '<s3-id>',
            key => '<s3-key',
        },

       gateway => {
            id => '<gateway-id>',
            key => '<gateway-key>',
        },
    );

Requests are then performed by specifying which credentials to use on the 
command line. Parameters for `curl` go after the `--`. E.g.

    ./s3curl.pl --id gateway -- -X DELETE -v http://localhost:9981/BucketToDelete

A small modification is required to add the endpoint where the gateway is 
running to the list of endpoints in the perl script. E.g. if you are running 
on localhost, you would add localhost to the @endpoints array as follows:

    # begin customizing here
    my @endpoints = ( 's3.amazonaws.com',
                      's3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com',
                      's3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com',
                      's3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com',
                      's3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com',
                      'localhost' );

## Server Tuning

When the gateway is handling a large number of concurrent requests, it may 
open too many file descriptors. It is suggested to increase the file 
descriptor limit. E.g.: in unix-type systems:

    ulimit -n 8192
